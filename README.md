# Microservices with Consul Service Discovery, JWT Authentication and KV Configuration

As part of a college presentation where I had to explain how Consul works, I created a hands-on project to demonstrate its core functionalities in a real microservices environment.

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using **HashiCorp Consul** for service discovery and KV configuration, along with **JWT-based authentication** and **basic round-robin load balancing** across service instances.

## üß© Architecture Overview

There are **three microservices** in this project:

### üì¶ Service 1 (`service-a`)
- Entry point for requests.
- Reads `audience` value from **Consul KV store**.
- Sends a request with a **JWT** and the audience (from KV) to **Service 3**.
- Forwards the result to **Service 2** using Consul service name instead of hardcoded IP/port.
- Allows observing **round-robin load balancing** when multiple Service 2 instances are registered in Consul.

### üì¶ Service 2 (`service-b`)
- Registered in Consul with two running instances.
- Receives requests from Service 1.
- Helps demonstrate **load balancing** through Consul DNS-based or HTTP API-based resolution.

### üì¶ Service 3 (`service-c`)
- Reads expected `audience` from Consul KV store.
- Exposes an endpoint that:
    - **Validates incoming JWT** (including audience claim).
    - Returns a value (e.g., a timestamp or random string).
- Acts as a backend protected service.

## üß™ Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Consul Service Discovery**: Service 1 locates Service 2 via service name, not IP.
- ‚úÖ **Consul KV**: Central config (e.g., JWT audience) fetched dynamically.
- ‚úÖ **JWT Authentication**: Service 3 validates JWT sent by Service 1.
- ‚úÖ **Load Balancing**: Service 2 runs multiple instances, balancing via Consul.
- ‚úÖ **Secure Communication**: Service-to-service communication includes JWT for secure access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

- Java 17 (Spring Boot)
- Consul Agent (Local/Dev mode)
- JWT (e.g., using `jjwt` or Spring Security)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)
